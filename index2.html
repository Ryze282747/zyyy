            My dearest baby,
 
Happy Valentine's Day! I wish I could be there to give you this letter in person, but since we're miles apart, I'm sending all my love this way. Five months ago, during that crazy storm, we met in ML, and I fell head over heels for you. I love you more than words can say, my baby.
 
I hope you'll never tire of me, even with my flaws. We have our disagreements sometimes, but I believe we can work through anything together. We're a team, and I wouldn't dream of giving up on us. You're my future wife, and I'll do everything I can to protect and cherish what we have. Let's promise to communicate openly and honestly with each other, alright? If there's ever a problem, let's face it together, always. And baby, please remember to eat properly! Taking care of yourself is so important.
 
My baby, I'm incredibly proud of you. Remember, I'm always here for you, my unwavering support. I know we have a long way to go, baby, but I'll wait for you, forever if I must. We made a promise to each other, didn't we? A promise to never leave each other's side. And that promise, my baby, is sacred to me. I want you to be my wife, my forever, but for now, let's focus on our studies. Real love can wait, right? We're young, and our future depends on our hard work. I'll always support your studies, baby, because your future is my priority. Remember that, okay? Your baby will always love you. So, don't overthink things or worry if I seem busy sometimes. My love for you is unwavering, and I would never do anything to jeopardize us. I know my limitations, and I'll always act responsibly. You're mine and only mine. I know you get jealous sometimes, it's okay, baby. It's a sign of your love, and I appreciate it. But please know, my heart belongs only to you. I promise. I love you so, so much, my baby. Mwa! Mwa!My dearest baby,

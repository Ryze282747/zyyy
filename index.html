            Hi babyyy, Happy Valentine's Day! I know I can't give you this
            letter personally. I wanted to give you a letter and flowers
            personally, but we're far apart, right? So I found a way to still
            send you a letter and flowers, even if it's not the same. I just want to
            tell you that I love you so much, baby. We've been together since
            last year! Let's keep going, baby. Don't leave me, okay? And don't ever
            get tired of me. I know I can be tiring, but always choose to stay
            with me, okay? Remember, baby, I promise I won't leave you anymore.
            I love you so much, my baby. Sending you hugs and kisses! Mwah
            mwah!

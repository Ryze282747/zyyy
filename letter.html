            My dearest baby,

            Happy Valentine's Day! I wanted to give you this letter in person, but since we're far apart, I found a way to send it to you anyway. I just want to say that I love you so much, baby. It's February 14th, and it's been a five months since I first met you on ML, during that storm. I fell in love with you right then and there.

            I hope you'll never get tired of me, even though I'm like this. I know we fight sometimes, but please, we can fix it together, right? We don't need to leave each other. For me, you're my future wife, and I wouldn't do anything that could ruin what we have. I promise that if we ever have a problem, we'll fix it together, always. You know me, you don't tell me when you have a problem. Change that, okay? And about your eating habits, eat on time, baby.

            Your baby is always here for you, I'm so proud of you. Always remember that I love you so much and i promise i won't leave you. Once again, Happy Valentine's Day, baby. I love you so much. Sending kisses and hugs, mwa!

            My dearest baby,  

Happy Valentine’s Day! I wish I could hand this letter to you in person, but since we’re far apart, I’m sending all my love this way. Five months ago, during that storm, we met in ML, and from that moment, I’ve fallen completely in love with you. I love you more than words can describe, my baby.  

I hope you’ll never grow tired of me, even with all my flaws. We may disagree sometimes, but I believe in us and our ability to get through anything together. We’re a team, and I would never give up on what we have. You are my future wife, and I will protect and cherish what we share. Let’s promise to always communicate openly and honestly, no matter what. If there’s ever an issue, we’ll face it together. And please, my baby, make sure to take care of yourself. Eat properly and stay healthy—it’s so important for your well-being.  

I’m so proud of you. I want you to always know that I’m here for you, as your unwavering support. Our journey together is just beginning, and I’ll wait for you, no matter how long it takes. We made a promise to never leave each other’s side, and that promise is sacred to me. I want you to be my forever, my wife, but for now, let’s focus on our studies. Real love can wait. We’re young, and our future depends on our hard work. I’ll always be there to support your dreams because your future matters most to me.  

Don’t worry or overthink if I seem busy at times. My love for you is constant, and I’ll never let anything come between us. I know my limits, and I’ll always act responsibly. You are mine, and only mine. I know you sometimes feel jealous, but please know that my heart belongs only to you. I promise.  

I love you so much, my baby. Mwa! Mwa!
